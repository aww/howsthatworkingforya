The low temperature shown for "Thursday" is often predicted to occur in the early hours of Friday!

This is probably what most take as the meaning anyway, but for the more literal minded it may seem like a lie.
Weather.gov is good about showing separate rows for Thursday, Thursday night
(which more obviously includes the early morning hours of Friday), and Friday.
In most cases it hardly matters it became obvious when I was looking at a large temperature swing predicted for Denver this week.
