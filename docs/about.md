This is a place for what I hope are interesting, beautiful, and funny visualizations of data.
It may also be a place for my thoughts on data, data science, science, machine learning, human learning,
and human yearning in data science for machine learning leading mostly to spurning by burning machines.

### More about me

I currently work at Glassdoor.com as a lead data scientist in the machine learning group.
All content on this site is entirely my own.

Formerly I was an experimental high energy physicist working mostly at CERN and a little at Fermilab.

Prior to this I had fantasies of number theory.

Prior to that I dabbled in embedded systems, computer graphics, and computer hardware design.

I put nearly everything back together again and prior to this I took everything apart.

I may have wanted to grow up and be a fireman. I did grow up.
