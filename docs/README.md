# Locally Linear blog source

This is the Jekyll source of the Locally Linear web pages / blog.
With a data and code-driven blog such as this my goal was to keep the code, data, and writing closely connected
so everything should reside in a common respository of which this is the `docs` portion.

I use [git LSF](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for all media and data files, which you will need to install use this repo.

Enjoy!
